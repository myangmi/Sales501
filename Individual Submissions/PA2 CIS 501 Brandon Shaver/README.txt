Sample Run Demo.docx is a file where I rough-drafted how I wanted my I/O to look.
Sample Run 1,2,3,4 are example test cases where I copied the text from the terminal after running the program. The number corresponds to the program state being tested.
Sample Run 5 should include cases for all program functions.
